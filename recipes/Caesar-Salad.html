    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Caesar Salad is a popular and refreshing dish made with crisp romaine
      lettuce, crunchy croutons, Parmesan cheese, and a creamy Caesar dressing.
      Originally created in Mexico by Italian chef Caesar Cardini, this salad
      has become a worldwide favorite known for its rich and tangy flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret to a delicious Caesar Salad lies in its dressing, which
      combines garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, egg yolk, Worcestershire sauce,
      and cheese to create a bold and creamy texture. It can be served as a
      light meal or as a side dish alongside grilled chicken, seafood, or pasta.
