      features just a few basic ingredients—garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, and
      parsley—but comes together to create a satisfying and aromatic meal.

      allowing the olive oil to absorb all the aromatic flavors. Tossed with

    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp red chili flakes <em>(adjust to taste)</em></li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li><strong>Optional:</strong> grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti
        according to the package instructions until al dente.
        <em>Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced
        garlic and <em>sauté until golden and fragrant</em>, about 1 to 2
        minutes.
        <strong><em> Be careful not to burn the garlic.</em></strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red chili flakes to the garlic and
        <em>stir for about 30 seconds</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the cooked spaghetti into the skillet,
        <strong>mixing well to coat the pasta in the garlic-chili oil.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>If the pasta seems dry,</em> add a few tablespoons of the reserved
        pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.

      <li>Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in the chopped parsley.</li>
